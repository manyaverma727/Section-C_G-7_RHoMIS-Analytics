## Analytical Pipeline

1. **Extract** — Raw dataset loaded and validated; data dictionary drafted (`01_extraction`)
2. **Clean & Transform** — Column selection, missing value handling, standardisation, feature engineering (`02_cleaning`)
3. **EDA** — Missing value analysis, distribution plots, cross-variable exploration (`03_eda`)
4. **Statistical Analysis** — Correlation, segmentation, and gap analysis (`04_statistical_analysis`)
5. **Final Load Prep** — Cleaned, analysis-ready CSV exported for Tableau (`05_final_load_prep`)
6. **Visualise** — Interactive Tableau dashboard published on Tableau Public
7. **Report** — Final report and presentation deck exported to `reports/`
